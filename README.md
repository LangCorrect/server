## Introduction

Welcome to the LangCorrect repository! This community-driven platform is designed to help users master writing in foreign languages. Ideal for language learners in search of practice and native speakers willing to lend a hand, LangCorrect offers a friendly, engaging environment where you can connect, share, and learn.

This repository houses the source code for the LangCorrect web application, developed using Django for the backend and the Django templating engine for the frontend. Additionally, a React client is currently in development; you can access its repository by clicking on [LangCorrect React Client](https://github.com/LangCorrect/react-client-mui).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker; if you donâ€™t have it yet, follow the installation instructions;
- Docker Compose; refer to the official documentation for the installation guide.
- Pre-commit; refer to the official documentation for the pre-commit.
- Cookiecutter; refer to the official GitHub repository of Cookiecutter

### Installation

#### Clone the repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:LangCorrect/server.git
```

#### Build the Stack

This can take a while, especially the first time you run this particular command on your development system:

```sh
docker compose -f local.yml build
```

This command will also download and install the required dictionary files. We use [Fugashi](https://github.com/polm/fugashi) and [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) for text parsing. Fugashi parses Japanese text and NLTK parses text in various languages.

To emulate a production environment, use `production.yml` instad.

#### Run the Stack

```sh
docker compose -f local.yml up
```

The site will be accessible via <http://localhost:3000>.

#### Setup pre-commit

Make sure to setup pre-commit, otherwise there will be a bunch of CI and Linter errors.

```sh
pre-commit install
```

### Seeding Your Database

Until PR #403 gets merged, there will be no convenient way to populate the database with mock data. You'll need to manually create users, posts, prompts, and corrections.

Note: User registrations require email confirmations. Check your terminal for this link!

### Execute Management Commands

As with any shell command that we wish to run in our container, this is done using the `docker compose -f local.yml run --rm` command:

```sh
docker compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py migrate
docker compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Here, django is the target service we are executing the commands against. Also, please note that the docker exec does not work for running management commands.

## Settings

This project was started with Cookiecutter Django. To see a table of configurable settings visit [settings](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html).

## Linters and Testing

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality. Below are the commands to run these tools.

### Linters

We use `flake8` for checking Python code for style and syntax errors and `pylint` for additional code analysis.

- Run `flake8` to check the entire project for PEP8 compliance
- Run `pylint <python files that you wish to lint>` to perform static code analysis

### Testing

#### Pytest

This project uses the [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.html), a framework for easily building simple and scalable tests.

```sh
docker compose -f local.yml run --rm django pytest #runs all tests
docker compose -f local.yml run --rm django pytest langcorrect/<app> #test specific app
```

#### Coverage

You should build your tests to provide the highest level of code coverage. You can run the pytest with code coverage by typing in the following command:

```sh
docker compose -f local.yml run --rm django coverage run -m pytest
docker compose -f local.yml run --rm django coverage report
```

#### Unit Tests

```sh
docker compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py test
```

### Sentry

Sentry is an error logging aggregator service. You can sign up for a free account at <https://sentry.io/signup/?code=cookiecutter> or download and host it yourself.
The system is set up with reasonable defaults, including 404 logging and integration with the WSGI application.

You must set the DSN url in production.
